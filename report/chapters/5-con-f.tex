combox is at a stage where it can be used by users as a tool to use
the storage provided by two file storage providers -- Google Drive and
Dropbox -- such that only part of each file in the encrypted form is
stored on the computers of the file storage providers; this method of
storing files on file storage providers makes it difficult but not
impossible for ``third parties'' to gain access to the user's personal
files.

combox is at version 0.2.2, it is a python package licensed under the
GNU General Public License version 3 or later. It is compatible with
GNU/Linux and OS X. The program is considered to be in ``alpha'' stage
and must be used for experimental use only, it is not recommended to
store critical files on storage provided by file storage providers
using combox. Individuals who wish to try combox would want to look at
\url{https://ricketyspace.net/combox/setup/} to get the program
installed on their machines; Individuals who want to hack/learn about
combox would want to look at
\url{https://ricketyspace.net/combox/api/}. combox's canonical source
repository is at \url{https://git.ricketyspace.net/combox}, the
repository is also mirrored at
\url{https://bitbucket.org/bgsucodeloverslab/combox/src} and
